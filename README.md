# OpenTrailMap

_[opentrailmap.us](https://opentrailmap.us)_

This is a web map application for viewing [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/about) trail data. The tool supports our [Trails Stewardship Initiative](https://openstreetmap.us/our-work/trails/), a community project to improve the quality of trail data in OpenStreetMap. The tool is still in early development, so now is a great time to get involved!

## UI features
- Select between different travel modes ([`foot`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:foot)/[`wheelchair`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:wheelchair)/[`bicycle`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:bicycle)/[`horse`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:horse)/[`atv`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:atv)).
- Click a feature to view its current tags and metadata.
- Use quick links to open the feature on [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org), iD, JOSM, and other viewers.

## Trails layer
Trail vector tiles are currently generated courtesy of [@zelonewolf](https://github.com/zelonewolf) using the schema file [here](https://github.com/ZeLonewolf/planetiler-scripts/blob/main/layers/osmus_trails.yml). Tiles are currently updated manually. This will be automated in the future with target update frequency of <24 hours.

### Legend
- Dark green lines are public paths.
- Pale green lines indicate the given travel mode is not allowed or not possible. There are a few factors:
  - [`access`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access) or the mode tag (like `foot`) is `no`/`private`/`discouraged`
  - The infrastructure is not sufficient, such as `smoothness=horrible` for `wheelchair`
- Dashed lines are `informal=yes`. Solid lines are `infomal=no` or `informal` not given.
- Purple lines donâ€™t have enough access tags to indicate if the given travel mode is allowed or possible (great mapping opportunities!)

### Points of interest
Some trail-related POIs are included on the map:
- [`amenity=ranger_station`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dranger_station): ranger stations are generally public visitor centers where trail users can get info or seek help
- [`highway=trailhead`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dtrailhead): trailheads are access points to trail networks, often with various amenities
